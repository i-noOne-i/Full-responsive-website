                        meant to be climbed. This interactive artwork was imagined by <b> Thomas Heatherwick and

                        Comprised of 154 intricately interconnecting flights of stairs -- almost <b> 2,500 individual
                            steps

                    <p>The most striking outdoor attraction at Hudson Yards is what’s known for the moment as the

                        Heatherwick. The
                        steel-and-shining-copper edifice is a series of 154 staircases (some 2,500 stairs in total) with
                        <b> 80 viewing platforms</b> for stopping and snapping shots of your surroundings. The Vessel is
                        considered a public art piece and is free to visit, but timed tickets are required to cut down
                        on crowds.
