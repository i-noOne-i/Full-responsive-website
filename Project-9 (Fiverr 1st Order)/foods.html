                    <p>Pastrami on rye is about as New York as it gets, second only to <b> Katz’s Delicatessen</b>. The
                        Jewish
                        deli serves the best pastrami sandwich in the city, complete with a pile of hand-carved beef
                        pastrami, yellow mustard and freshly baked rye bread. This is a must-eat in NYC.</p>
                    <p>Beef plate is the traditional cut of meat for making pastrami, although it is now common in the
                        United States to see it made from beef brisket, beef round, and turkey. New York pastrami is
                        generally made from beef navel, which is the ventral part of the plate. It is cured in
                        brine, coated with a mix of spices such as garlic, coriander, black pepper, paprika, cloves,
                        allspice, and mustard seed, and then smoked. Finally, the meat is steamed until the connective
                        tissues within the meat break down into gelatin.


                        Pastrami sandwich, made with pita bread, harissa, and roasted peppers
                        Greek immigrants to Salt Lake City in the <b> early 1960s</b> introduced a cheeseburger topped
                        with
                        pastrami and a special sauce. The pastrami cheeseburger has since remained a staple of local
                        burger chains in Utah.</p>

                    <p>Carb connoisseurs from around the world travel to NYC to taste an authentic New York bagel. Grab
                        your own at another New York classic, <b> Russ & Daughters</b>. The 107-year-old shop still
                        serves the
                        city’s best bagels and all the traditional toppings (lox, smoked fish, cream cheeses…) you could
                        want.
                    </p>
                    <p>What makes a great NYC bagel? It’s a question New Yorkers have perennially debated (election year
                        or not) since the late 19th century when the dish was first brought to the city by Jewish
                        immigrants from Eastern Europe. But after all of these years of arguing, perhaps, it’s the
                        subjectivity of what makes the perfect bagel—and what goes on top or in between it—that makes
                        New York’s signature baked good so outstanding to begin with.

                        For Bari Musacchio, founder of <b> Baz Bagel</b>, “the perfect bagel has a crispy crust, chewy
                        inside,
                        and is the right size.” And according to Musacchio, what makes New York’s bagels so incomparable
                        are its five basic, yet specialty ingredients: flour, salt, water, yeast and malt. The malt,
                        Musacchio explains, is essential, and can’t be substituted with a sweetener, like brown sugar,
                        which is a common shortcut outside of New York.

                    <p>Has there ever been a better time to eat a frankfurter? <b> Feltman’s</b>, the world’s first
                        bunned
                        wiener, is back where it belongs on Coney Island, right next to the <b> Cyclone roller
                            coaster</b>. (A
                        tip: ride first, then eat.) Thanks to the superb work of new-wave butchers, who buy
                        hormone-and-antibiotic-free beef and pork that come from contented cows and pigs, and cure and
                        smoke their own hot dogs, you no longer have to feel bad or afraid before you tuck into a tube
                        steak. And even condiment purists have got to admit that we’re living in a golden age of hot-dog
                        toppings, and that when spooned and squirted onto a frank, kimchee and Kewpie mayo go together
                        like bacon and eggs. What do we look for in a hot dog besides good meat; spicy, smoky flavor;
                        and zingy condiments? For one, a natural casing that seals in not only the juice but the smoke,
                        and snaps like fire kindling when you bite into it. Size matters: Sleek and streamlined usually
                        beat big and bulky, but balance and proportion and dog-to-bun ratio is all. And a little
                        nostalgia never hurts. Here, then, are the absolute best hot dogs in New York, and some
                        excellent places to eat them in.</p>

                    <p><b> Halal carts</b> slinging styrofoam plates piled high with falafel, shawarma and rice are
                        ubiquitous
                        in New York, but you'll recognize "the King" by the seemingly endless line crowding the sidewalk
                        beside it.

                    </p>
                    <h2>Milk Truck</h2>
                    <p>
                        Bessie, Milk Truck's sunshine-yellow food truck, is a welcome sight for hungry New Yorkers
                        during lunch hour.
                        Every day, the truck's perpetually cheerful staff hawk classic American comfort foods like mac
                        and cheese and turkey chili.
                        The most popular item by far is the grilled cheese sandwich.
                        There are three variations: the classic, the classic with onion and mustard, and a hearty
                        three-cheese version with apple.
                        Despite not having a regular location -- Bessie's daily whereabouts must be tracked online --
                        Milk Truck has become a fixture in the New York street food scene thanks to its fiercely loyal
                        following.

                    <h2>Red Hook Lobster Pound food truck</h2>
                    <p>
                        New Yorkers don't need to go to New England for a good lobster roll.
                        Thanks to Big Red, Red Hook Lobster Pound's lobster shack on wheels, they only need to walk to
                        the curb. Rolls come Maine-style, served cold with mayo, or Connecticut-style, served warm with
                        butter and lemon, each stuffed with a quarter pound of fresh Maine lobster.
                        Despite a price tag high that's high for the streets -- <b> $16 per roll</b> at the time of
                        writing --
                        the truck still sells between 300-400 rolls every two hours.

                        Lumpia Shack
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Though Lumpia Shack has recently upgraded to its own brick-and-mortar, its original location at
                        Brooklyn's Smorgasburg street food market still remains.
                        Lines form before the tiny street stall as early as 11 a.m. each Saturday for lumpia, crispy,
                        Filipino-inspired spring rolls. Each roll is made using locally sourced ground pork, roasted
                        duck or truffled adobo mushrooms, hand-rolled and then deep-fried.
                        Unlike regular street food, Lumpia Shack's plating is restaurant quality: the lumpia are
                        arranged artfully on a tray, drizzled with homemade sauce and garnished with pea shoots and
                        pickled vegetables.

                    <p>No disrespect to the dollar slice, but sometimes (read always) it’s worth springing for a
                        traditional New York-style pizza. Where better to sample an authentic city-style slice than at
                        Lombardi’s, the first pizzeria in the United States?</p>
                    <p>"THE BEST PIZZA IN NEW YORK CITY" is a bit of a misnomer. The best pizza, after all, is only in
                        NYC. Even if you could perfectly preserve a fresh slice—born from our signature tap water,
                        prepared according to the basic specifications of the Italian immigrants who first brought it
                        stateside, and crisped in a real deal NYC coal or wood burning oven—and eat it across state
                        lines, it still wouldn’t taste quite as good as it would within the boundaries of the five
                        boroughs. Call it magic or cognitive bias, the holy trinity of cheese, sauce, and dough just
                        tastes better here. And the rest of the globe knows it. You’ll find “New York style” slices in
                        world capitals, international airports, and in US cities that claim confidence in their own
                        regional takes. Behind every California, Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, or New Haven-style pie,
                        there’s always an NYC facsimile hiding out on the menu, whispering, fuhgeddaboudit. Sure, it’ll
                        do in a pinch, but you haven’t truly experienced pizza until you’ve had it in <b> Manhattan,
                            Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, or Staten Island</b>.
